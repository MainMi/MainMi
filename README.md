### ðŸš€ About Me


I am a Software Engineer currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute with a GPA of 8.5/10. Alongside my studies, I am actively expanding my expertise in software development by diving deeper into algorithms, data structures, and advanced programming concepts.

### ðŸ“’ My Journey
My love for coding began at 14, when I started learning Python on a mobile phone. Coming from a large family, I didnâ€™t have access to a computer, so I adapted and learned with the tools I had. Despite the limitations of mobile IDEs, I developed a program for Dungeons & Dragons calculations. However, I realized that compiling and sharing these programs wasnâ€™t practical on a phone. Thatâ€™s when I decided to build a website instead.

After one to two months of trial and error, I successfully created my first functional website. That experience ignited my passion for web development. Soon, a senior full-stack developer who also taught courses at Okten School noticed my determination and gave me access to their professional courses. Completing those courses solidified my decision to pursue full-stack development as a career.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects, refined my skills, and continue to learn and grow every day. Whether itâ€™s building websites, optimizing business solutions, or experimenting with game mechanics, Iâ€™m always excited to take on new challenges.
